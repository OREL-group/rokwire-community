## Work-a-thon (and Sprint) Guide 

What is a Hackathon (or Ideathons, or Docathons, or Sprint or that matter)?

Hackathons, Docathons, Ideathons, and Sprints are coordinated work sessions that allow collaborators to get together at a defined time and make progress on a set of issues. Hackathons typically involve experimenting with code, while Docathons involve developing documentation. Ideathons provide a means to brainstorm and flesh out ideas using the issue-based structure of a Hackathon. Sprints are focused work sessions where time is devoted to a tightly-defined set of tasks.

Issues can be pre-defined, or prepared as an initial step during the event. Issue tracking can be done in Github or another platform such as Trello.
