## Guide to Public Work Events. 

Rokwire Community hosts four types of public event: Hackathon, Ideathons, Docathons, and Sprints

Hackathons, Docathons, Ideathons, and Sprints are coordinated work sessions that allow collaborators to get together at a defined time and make progress on a set of issues. 

__Hackathons__ typically involve experimenting with and exploring code, and creating follow-upissues from the results. The term "hackathon" means "clever marathon", and the idea of this type of session is to find new solutions to persistent problems.

__Docathons__ involve developing documentation. We will work on the various community docs, ranging from contributing to the Community Wiki to interacting with our [API Docs in Swagger](https://api.rokwire.illinois.edu/docs/). 

__Ideathons__ provide a means to brainstorm and flesh out ideas using the general structure of a Hackathon. Ideathons are explicitly not code-related, and involve coming up with new processes and action items. 

__Sprints__ are focused work sessions where time is devoted to a tightly-defined set of tasks. Sprints usually follow-up on a Hackthon in that issues created during a Hackathon are addressed during the Sprint. Sprints can also be used to resolve a set of outstanding issues in a short, focused burst of attention.

__Issue Creation__ Issues can be pre-defined, or prepared as an initial step during the event. Issue tracking can either be done in Github (recommended for Hackathons and Docathons) or another platform such as [Trello](https://trello.com/en-US).   

__Working Open__ Check out this short guide from Mozilla, which provides information about [Working Open](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/introduction-to-working-open/). Github also offers a guide to [Hackathons](https://github.com/github/hackathons).
