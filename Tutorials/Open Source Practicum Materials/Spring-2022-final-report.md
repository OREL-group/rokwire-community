### Abstract
In this paper, I will be describing my open source community. Along with that, I will also be discussing the purpose of this community, activities that this community will be engaging in, as well as the general social infrastructure that will be employed in the community. The goal of this paper is to establish the learning that I attained through my various lectures with Dr. Bradly Alicea during my Rokwire Community internship by hypothetically applying the lessons to a nonexistent community of my own making.

### Introduction
According to OpenSource.com [1], open-source “...refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.” To have an open-source project means that a percentage of your project’s code is open and available to the public to observe or potentially use. One example of a prominent open-source community that I know of is OpenWorm [2], which is an open-source project that aims to essentially make a realistic worm model with the hopes that the knowledge of the worm’s nervous system will allow them to understand general intelligence. This volunteer-based project is a great example of some of the advantages present with open-source projects, such as the labor of motivated individuals seeking no more than to have a part in something greater. Other reasons for having an open-source community include allowing the public to have knowledge of the work your community is doing. Such transparency is crucial for developing good will with individuals not directly connected to your project. Open source is also good because it allows other people to use parts of your work to create their own interesting takes on your project, allowing your work to impact more people than it originally would have as its own thing. 
One such example is a video game known as Friday Night Funkin’ [3], which started as a small indie project hosted on Newgrounds (https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) and available for download. Because of the open-source nature of the project, not only has the original project increased in popularity, but there is a vast community of creators coming together to create new and unique gaming experiences for no cost at all. Finally, open-source projects are good because they give less experienced people an opportunity to engage with code in an open and (hopefully) welcoming environment, without risk of being fired. However, while it is possible to be removed from an open-source community project, most communities tend to be inclusive.. In my opinion, open-source, feels like the ideal future of code from an information and humanitarian standpoint, but from a capitalist standpoint, I am not sure if it is possible to make a steady income with an open-source project due to the fact that it is usually free labor, as well as the fact that other people could simply take your work and claim it as their own, but that should be solvable through grants and licenses, which I will get into later when I describe my own community.

#### Purpose
The purpose of my project is to create a gaming platform similar to products like Discord, where people who enjoy the same games can form communities with like-minded individuals. The appeal to my project specifically is that the software will be (almost) fully customizable, allowing people with access to the code and a bit of knowledge to make an experience that is entirely unique and suits their needs and/or desires. This program would be compatible with the likes of Discord as well, if that would be possible (It may be an issue since Discord may consider outside programming as malevolent or competition). Ideally, the project would encompass gaming of all kinds, which would include board games, mobile games, console games, and maybe even sports. Because of the fact that the software is open-source, it means that it would be much easier to customize it for all of these applications. At first, ideally, the software would be designed for PC platforms. Since the project would be developed on PC, this feels like a natural first step. Down the line, however, we would expand the capabilities of the software from PC games exclusively to the other platforms mentioned above. The team will first start by doing outside research about existing software that handles the same situations as our project, finding out what they do well and what they need to work on. Of course, our project won’t only be an improved version of existing software, it needs to be unique and offer options that the competition does not have, other than extensive, nigh-endless customizability. An idea I have is implementing system share, which would allow those with weaker systems to share a system with a friend to play local co-op games together or potentially online co-op as well. Another potentially strong idea would be a leaderboard for specific communities which could be directly integrated into the software instead of a less technical self-report system. Things like these, from my perspective, have yet to be combined into a single program, therefore making the project unique.

#### Target Audience
Our ideal target audience would start out as gamers. Gamers meaning people that play video games, as our service would start out as a PC exclusive product. Afterwards, once we expand to other types of games, naturally, our product’s audience will extend to those individuals. For those extended audiences, there’s a chance that they will have less coding experience. For that purpose, we will make our project easily customizable so that even those with limited experience with coding will be able to tailor their own version. However, that won’t limit the expression that those with coding experience will be able to convey. Those with prior experience or the willingness to learn will have more opportunities than those who do not, to encourage and incentivize using our code, since this is an open-source project. Not to mention, it would be unrealistic to have the same level of influence with and without code, considering you must code the non-coding customizations. The ways in which the software would be customizable would be mostly up to the discretion of the coder, but base functionality would most likely be non-negotiable, such as the ability to text. Different ways that people might consider customizing the software might be to replace written text with emoji-exclusive text channels, applying different vocal filters to voice chats, unique filters to be applied on video streams or shares, and other interesting ideas to bring personality to each product.

#### Strategy
	
__Code Access__
To open-source our code, we will be having it publicly available on GitHub, where anyone can look at it and download it for their own purposes. However, they will not be publicly available to modify in the main git, as that is only the responsibility of those within the community at the discretion of those in the community. The downloaded, individual use copies can be modified to the heart’s content of those that choose to obtain them, with some restrictions that will be mentioned later in the licenses section of this paper. Version control will also be handled in git, with small version updates being released on a regular schedule (bug fixes, feature enhancements), but large ones being held off until significant change is brought about (new features, more compatibility). Visitors of the GitHub page will be able to browse these different versions and given permission to download and use any version they would like.
The ability of those in the community to alter code in the community will differ, depending on their rank within the project’s community. Their rank will be decided based on the significance of their contribution to the project; the more you contribute, the more you will be rewarded. While this may seem counterproductive at the outset (Those with little input will not be able to make many contributions), it is an effective way of gauging the commitment of community members, as those with higher commitment are more likely to be invested in the project and seek the best of it, more likely to be trustworthy to make greater changes, and more likely to serve as a good role model for others trying to get involved.
Our community believes that the more open our project is, the better. Due to this mantra, we will be making sure that we are transparent not only with the versions that we release, but our reasoning for decisions we make as well. We will listen to community feedback and make revisions as necessary, as our users are what make us the project that we are. Without our users, our project would not exist. However, code thievery and bad actors will be a big issue with this openness, as anyone could easily copy our code and pass it off as their own, as well as use the knowledge of how the code works to create backdoors or hack into people’s private affairs. For this reason, our community will be sure to have people responsible for keeping up to date with the latest security measures to maintain the safety of our project and those that choose to use it. Unfortunately, because of this, there is a good chance that security protocols will not be shareable, as it could pose a risk too great to those using the software. As for code thievery, we will be establishing licenses to take care of that issue, engaging in litigation should those licenses be compromised by a third party with intent to harm.
__License__
For our community’s choice of license, we will use the MIT License [4]. I have selected this license because of the strength of protection that it entails, along with the leniency it offers to those that wish to use our works with good intentions. The brevity of the license also ensures that people will be willing to read the text, making them aware of the things that they are and are not allowed to do.

#### Community Events
__Community Meetings__
Now that we have covered the logistics of the project, we will discuss events that will be held within the community to engage members in a fun and educational way, as well as events that will be imperative to the success of the project. We have planned to hold meetings which will occur weekly, where important issues will be raised and equally important changes which will affect the project and the community at large will be addressed. Those that will be allowed to participate directly in these meetings will be limited to those of great influence within the community. However, should enough people that are not as high in the community agree on a subject and consider it a matter of great importance to the project, then the issue in question may come to pass without the direct involvement of any single influence. That is to say, the people’s vote is considered a member of the meeting. The occasional big meetings will not only include those that contribute code to the project. Individuals that are responsible for funding the project, such as a Board of Directors or a group that has offered a grant, will have unlimited access to these meetings as well, as they are invested in the success of the community. Otherwise, for a standard meeting, anyone is welcome to join in and offer their direct input, as the input of the community is important to the success of the project. They will be allowed to offer input directly to community members, but will not have the final say in any direction-altering decision making processes, as that right will be left to the contributors in the community, the ones responsible for bringing the project to life. However, it would be most preferable for all parties to agree on decisions before going public with them, but if there does happen to be some dispute, decisions will be made based on a majority vote. Of course, high-ranking contributors and the founder (that would be me) will have a more influential vote than others, but a great enough outcry should have the power to overturn decisions made by me and other high-ranking members. The hierarchy of voting power for rigid, project-direction-deciding decisions would be as follows: Me, high-ranking contributors, the Board of Directors and popular vote among lower members, then the general public. Though, the general public will not be able to make contributions to these decisions until the information in question has been made public and lower-ranking contributors will not be able to voice their concerns until the meeting has been adjourned, at which point the notes of what occurred will be told to them first before being made public. Within that window, they will be allowed to voice concerns about decisions made in the hopes of overturning them via popular vote.
__Special Events__
The special events will come in the way of Hackathons, Docathons, Ideathons, Community Programming Bootcamps, and/or more. I decided on each of these events because I found that these could not only be good opportunities for people to gain experience with these elements of the coding experience, but that they could be a chance for some friendly competition among peers as well, not to mention a great opportunity for those with less experience to be able to gain said experience with coding and working in a team, both valuable skills for an open source project member to have. It also allows people within the community the chance to get to know each other in a friendly, yet competitive environment.
Hackathons are, according to Rasmussen University [5], “... an event, usually hosted by a tech company or organization, where programmers get together for a short period of time to collaborate on a project. …  the events generally only last 24 hours or take place over a weekend.” Hackathons are a generally good way to get community members to become more active, as the limited timeframe makes them all the more appealing, not to mention the spontaneity of such events is good for getting community members to come together and think up creative solutions to interesting problems quickly and as a team.
According to Berkeley Institute of Data Science [6], “The Docathon is like a hackathon but is focused on developing material and tools for documentation.” Unlike the hackathon, a docathon is focused on more concept-based implementation without a great focus on code. This is a great way for those that have good coding fundamentals to show how to properly manage a project, the actual project aside.
Ideathons are, according to the University of Washington [7], “... a short, intensive, workshop-like experience for students to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.” It is an event where “Participants work in teams and use design thinking and innovative learning practices to ideate and collaborate on possible solutions.” For an ideathon, ideas take the forefront, and the main focus is creating solutions to unique coding problems, without necessarily developing said solutions. For example, this paper could be an ideathon project, outside from the fact that it has taken me a long time to finish this paper, whereas ideathons are very fast, like hackathons.
I decided on Community Programming Bootcamps because I thought having the opportunity for those that are less experienced with code to learn them in a safe environment would help them with acclimating to the project community, as well as provide us with the opportunity to instill into them the habits of the community, making their code easier to read for those of us working on it, as well as making it easier for them to read the code already within the project, too.

#### Sustainability
For our coding language, we aim to select languages that have a lot of survivability. Such languages must exceed in quality, ease of use, and effectiveness for our project in particular. For this reason, I have opted to select Python, as it is an easy-to-use language that is capable of great things when properly implemented in a project. It is also the only language that I have knowledge in. However, I am aware that the entire project cannot be completed in a single language, and for this reason, I have elected to institute another language as well: C++. C++ is the coding standard for all things video games and if our application is to have any communication with other systems, it would stand to reason that using their language would make communications smoother. Since they will be operating under the same language, translation time between code should be much smoother, resulting in a more efficient experience.
On top of selecting these two languages, we will be sure to have a maintainer who will ensure that our project keeps up-to-date with coding practices, ensuring that our project’s code never falls out of touch. On top of that, we will be sure to keep an eye out on developments in the coding space to make sure that our project is using the best and most reliable version of software available, as sometimes, the updated version of a coding language sometimes is unreliable. Along with the maintainer, we will have a community manager, who is responsible for managing community affairs, such as planning/hosting events, onboarding new members, and other responsibilities.
