__Project Description:__ We are seeking an intern to support the establishment of a virtual environment infrastructure.

You will be involved in helping to construct, manage, and grow community in these space as we inaugurate this exciting element of our open-source organization!
 
__Qualifications:__ Ideally, the applicant should be comfortable working with 3-D modeling software (Blender) in addition to working on associated programming tasks. Experience with perspective drawing may also be helpful. We will use version-control and project management tools quite extensively, so having a working familiarity with such platforms is expected. While it is not required that you have previous experience working with an open-source organization, applicants must be willing to adopt an “open” ethos.
