Application period is in early spring. Contact us to see if projects are active for this year.

Creation of Interactive Applications for the Open-source Contributors Community
Support the Rokwire Community of mobile developers by creating sample applications as tutorials for new open-source contributors. Rokwire is an open-source platform for developing mobile applications that enable smart communities. Existing applications include the Illinois App (campus app for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) and Safer (a public health and COVID management app). These apps will allow potential contributors to create their own capabilities and talents for incorporation into a customized smart community mobile app. Capabilities and talents are build atop the Rokwire building blocks, which enable users to have a customized, privacy-assured experience. Your efforts will also help to facilitate adoption of the Rokwire platform, serve to establish a set of community standards, and participate in educational opportunities related to open-source. This project requires familiarity with some or all of the following languages: Python, Golang, Dart, and Flutter.

Extended Reality (XR) for Open-source Community-building
Help the Rokwire Community to develop an extended reality (XR) infrastructure. The focus will be building upon the Mozilla platforms A-Frame (web framework), Mozilla Hubs (virtual rooms), and Spoke (3-D social scenes). Your efforts will culminate in two outcomes. The first outcomes involves developing a pipeline of virtual experiences for education and collaboration in the Rokwire Community. Secondarily, we would like to develop Augmented Reality resources to be integrated into mobile apps. Contribute to our broader vision of smart communities in XR! Familiarity with Python, JavaScript, and HTML are a must, and familiarity with Dart and Golang is desirable.
