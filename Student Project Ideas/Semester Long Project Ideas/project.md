### Creation of Interactive Applications for the Open-source Contributors Community
Support the Rokwire Community of mobile developers by creating sample applications as tutorials for new open-source contributors. [Rokwire](https://rokwire.org/) is an open-source platform for developing mobile applications that enable smart communities. Existing applications include the Illinois App (campus app for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) and Safer (a public health and COVID management app). 

We are interested in creating programming templates in the form of interactive programming. This will consist of breaking down the steps to creating things in Rokwire and demonstrating this to potential open-source contributors. These programming templates will be distributable in the form of video tutorials and digital notebooks.  These templates will allow open-source contributors with limited understanding of the architecture to create their own capabilities and talents for inclusion as functionality in a community mobile app. 

One prerequisite to this project is to develop a working understanding of the Rokwire architecture. A starting point for this is the  [Building Blocks API](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-building-blocks-api) and various [Community Wiki](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/wiki/API-Ecosystem-Diagram) entries. In Rokwire, capabilities and talents are build atop the Rokwire building blocks, which enable users to have a customized, privacy-assured experience. Your efforts will also help to facilitate adoption of the Rokwire platform, serve to establish a set of community standards, and participate in educational opportunities related to open-source. This project requires familiarity with some or all of the following languages: Python, Golang, Dart, and Flutter.

### Extended Reality (XR) for Open-source Community-building
Help the Rokwire Community to develop an extended reality (XR) infrastructure. The focus will be building upon the Mozilla platforms A-Frame (web framework), Mozilla Hubs (virtual rooms), and Spoke (3-D social scenes). Your efforts will culminate in two outcomes. The first outcomes involves developing a pipeline of virtual experiences for education and collaboration in the Rokwire Community. Secondarily, we would like to develop Augmented Reality resources to be integrated into mobile apps. Contribute to our broader vision of smart communities in XR! Familiarity with Unity or Blender is a must. Experience with C++, Python, or Java are desirable.
