See [The six types of pull request (Github)](https://ben.balter.com/2015/12/08/types-of-pull-requests/) to get a sense of ways to contribute on Github.

* in particular, works in progress, early feedback, and line-by-line review.

Works in progress: submit a [form for your ideas](---)

Early feedback: issue a pull request according to our [template](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md), include your submission, and start an [issue or set of issues](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/issues) and then incorporate them on the [Ideas project board](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/projects/5).

Line-by-line review: once your issues are defined, establish a [technology stack](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/tree/master/Themes%20of%20the%20Month%20(2021)/Full-Stack%20Community), [review your issues](http://publish.illinois.edu/bradly-alicea/2020/10/28/infinite-issues-issue-infinity-how-to-break-down-a-wicked-problem/), and then implement.
