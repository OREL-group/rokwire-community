See [The six types of pull request (Github)](https://ben.balter.com/2015/12/08/types-of-pull-requests/) to get a sense of ways to contribute on Github.    

* in particular, works in progress, early feedback, and line-by-line review.   

* once your issues are defined, establish a [technology stack](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/tree/master/Themes%20of%20the%20Month%20(2021)/Full-Stack%20Community), [review your issues](http://publish.illinois.edu/bradly-alicea/2020/10/28/infinite-issues-issue-infinity-how-to-break-down-a-wicked-problem/) for the proper level of granularity, and then implement.
