## Setting up a code review system

Code reviews are useful for a number of reasons. These include: improving readability, eliminating runtime errors, and complicance with organizational standards. can be done using several methods:

1) asynchronous (work checked using an automated program).

2) synchronous (with another human in the loop to double -check work as it is produced).

3) meeting-based code review (meet with the Community Manager or create an issue for a developer review).

For external contributors, we recommend that development proceed using strategy #1 (and strategy #2 is preferred). Meeting-based code reviews should occur at the beginning and end of the process -- plan your contributions by communicating them in diagrams and pseudo-code, then once the the changes are implemented, submit them for line-wise review.

External contributors to the Rokwire Community should use a [git-forking model](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/fork/) for code review and intergration. Create a fork of your own, and merge back to the main repository via pull request. To review changes on your own fork, or to interact directly with the internal development team, the [git-branching model](https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/fork/) can be used to differentiate between things meant to for test and review  (/feature/issue#), things in development (/develop), and things meant for production (/release/#).
