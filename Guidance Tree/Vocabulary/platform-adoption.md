## Platform Adoption

Platform adoption involves users or organization who fork a Github repository and attempt to adopt an instance of the software for their own needs (adoptee). Adoption can also include users who download and use the software. Resources in this area should reflect information about current adoption trends and tools to help adopters make their modifications in synchronization with the "trunk" (source of the fork, or adopter organization) open source community.
