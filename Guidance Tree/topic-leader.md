## Promoter/Topical Leader

Do you have the ability to find new topics for discussion that other people find interesting? Is there a specific Rokwire-related topic that you would like to promote or explore in more detail? Then you will be interested in participating in the Rokwire community as a __promoter__ or __topical leader__. Promoters and topical leaders will work to research topical areas for research purposes, recruit people to our community for collaboration or special events, and help to build a critical mass of scholars and scholarship in the areas of smart, healthy communities and mobile computing. All leaders and other participants will abile by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [community standards](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

__Topical Leaders__ will focus on the research aspect of community discussion. Topical leaders will propose topics for future discussion, identify areas of interest for future lecture series and forums, and work with the broader academic community to make the Rokwire Community an integral part of the academic discussion on leading topics.

Community participants can overlap between [promoters](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/Guidance%20Tree/technology-evangelist-promoter.md) and topical leaders.
