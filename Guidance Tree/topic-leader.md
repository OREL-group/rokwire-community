## Promoter/Topical Leader

Do you have the ability to find new topics for discussion that other people find interesting? Is there a specific Rokwire-related topic that you would like to promote or explore in more detail? Then you will be interested in participating in the Rokwire community as a __promoter__ or __topical leader__. Promoters and topical leaders will work to research topical areas for research purposes, recruit people to our community for collaboration or special events, and help to build a critical mass of scholars and scholarship in the areas of smart, healthy communities and mobile computing. All leaders and other participants will abile by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [community standards](https://github.com/rokwire/rokwire-community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

__Promoters__ will promote the community and provide assistance in recruiting interested parties for future collaboration. Promoters will increase our social media reach work with our internal discussion teams (Slack and Discord) to provide a welcoming and stimulating environment. Promoters will also work with topical leaders and the community manager to find speakers for our lecture series and forums.

__Topical Leaders__ will focus on the research aspect of community discussion. Topical leaders will propose topics for future discussion, identify areas of interest for future lecture series and forums, and work with the broader academic community to make the Rokwire Community an integral part of the academic discussion on leading topics.

Community participants can overlap between promoters and topical leaders.
