General Overview of Rokwire: following up on the Rokwire white paper (circa January 2020), this is an opportunity to publish a broad overview of the Rokwire platform. Desired skills: editorial, literature review, expertise in Rokwire or Software Development.  

Open-source Handbook: provides an overview of the Rokwire Community, particularly initiatives, future goals, core values, and measurements of participation. 

10 Applications for the Rokwire Platform: we are soliciting well-formed ideas for the top 10 applications that can be enabled by the Rokwire platform. Think big and bold! Some of your ideas will make it into the paper, while others could become standalone projects. Desired skills (but any skillset might be useful): editorial, brainstorming, expertise in Rokwire or Software Development, Art and Design.  

Modeling Smart Communities with SimCity and VR: provides a vision for bridging the idea of smart, healthy communities with simulation platforms that in trun might enable features in a computational platform such as Rokwire (currently dubbed "Virtual Rokwire").
